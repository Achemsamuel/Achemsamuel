### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

I guess something I did must have caught your attention and brought you here. 
### Welcome!!!

My name is Achem Samuel. I am an iOS Engineer at [Softcom](https://softcom.ng), currently working on [Koya](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1513597856), [DSLMS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dslms/id1494856444) & [MTN_DML](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mtn-digital-mobile-library/id1354707858) - learning and communication applications that provides real-time content and resources to users on the go!

I currently lead the iOS Engineering effort in the learn divisoin at Softcom, and I have the most fun when I am talking about Software Architecture and Design Patterns ðŸ•º

The bulk of my work including libraries I've created are in private repositories ðŸ˜¥; I know, I promise to do better ðŸ¤—, so you'd definitely be seeing more of my work here!
